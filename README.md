## A simple web app to understand basic concepts of django like url routing, views, rendering HTTP responses and templates etc.

### You can enter some text in text area and can select the operations like removing punctuations,removing spaces and capitalizing, and those operations will be performed. 

### Used some bootstrap elements. Again it's just a simple app with no much logic or functions. Nothing much to expect.

### Thanks
